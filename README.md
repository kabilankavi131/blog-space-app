I developed this blog application using a combination of modern web technologies. The frontend is built with React and TypeScript for strong type safety and maintainability. For styling, I used Tailwind CSS to create a clean and responsive UI.

The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, providing a robust API. I chose MySQL for data storage, ensuring scalability. User authentication is handled using session-based authentication instead of JWT.
